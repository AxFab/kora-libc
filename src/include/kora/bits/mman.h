// The mapping is not backed by any file; its contents are initialized to zero. The fd and offset arguments are ignored; however, some implementations require fd to be -1 if MAP_ANONYMOUS (or MAP_ANON) is specified, and portable applications should ensure this. The use of MAP_ANONYMOUS in conjunction with MAP_SHARED is only supported on Linux since kernel 2.4.
#define MAP_ANON MAP_ANONYMOUS
#define MAP_ANONYMOUS 0x10

// This flag is ignored. (Long ago, it signaled that attempts to write to the underlying file should fail with ETXTBUSY. But this was a source of denial-of-service attacks.)
#define MAP_DENYWRITE 0x20
// This flag is ignored.
#define MAP_EXECUTABLE 0x40
// Compatibility flag. Ignored.
#define MAP_FILE 0x80
// Don't interpret addr as a hint: place the mapping at exactly that address. addr must be a multiple of the page size. If the memory region specified by addr and len overlaps pages of any existing mapping(s), then the overlapped part of the existing mapping(s) will be discarded. If the specified address cannot be used, mmap() will fail. Because requiring a fixed address for a mapping is less portable, the use of this option is discouraged.
#define MAP_FIXED 0x100
// Used for stacks. Indicates to the kernel virtual memory system that the mapping should extend downward in memory.
#define MAP_GROWSDOWN 0x200
// Allocate the mapping using "huge pages." See the Linux kernel source file Documentation/vm/hugetlbpage.txt for further information.
#define MAP_HUGETLB 0x400
// Lock the pages of the mapped region into memory in the manner of mlock(2). This flag is ignored in older kernels.
#define MAP_LOCKED 0x800
// Only meaningful in conjunction with MAP_POPULATE. Don't perform read-ahead: only create page tables entries for pages that are already present in RAM. Since Linux 2.6.23, this flag causes MAP_POPULATE to do nothing. One day the combination of MAP_POPULATE and MAP_NONBLOCK may be reimplemented.
#define MAP_NONBLOCK 0x1000
// Do not reserve swap space for this mapping. When swap space is reserved, one has the guarantee that it is possible to modify the mapping. When swap space is not reserved one might get SIGSEGV upon a write if no physical memory is available.
#define MAP_NORESERVE 0x2000
// Populate (prefault) page tables for a mapping. For a file mapping, this causes read-ahead on the file. Later accesses to the mapping will not be blocked by page faults. MAP_POPULATE is only supported for private mappings.
#define MAP_POPULATE 0x4000
// Allocate the mapping at an address suitable for a process or thread stack.
#define MAP_STACK 0x8000
// Don't clear anonymous pages. This flag is intended to improve performance on embedded devices. This flag is only honored if the kernel was configured with the CONFIG_MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED option. Because of the security implications, that option is normally enabled only on embedded devices (i.e., devices where one has complete control of the contents of user memory).
#define MAP_UNINITIALIZED 0x10000
// Put the mapping into the first 2 Gigabytes of the process address space. This flag is only supported on x86-64, for 64-bit programs. It was added to allow thread stacks to be allocated somewhere in the first 2GB of memory, so as to improve context-switch performance on some early 64-bit processors. Modern x86-64 processors no longer have this performance problem, so use of this flag is not required on those systems. The MAP_32BIT flag is ignored when MAP_FIXED is set.
#define MAP_32BIT 0x20000
// Allocate the mapping at an address suitable for a process heap.
#define MAP_HEAP 0x40000
